2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks ZYNQ_CORE_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 27 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped False Path timing constraint is set between clocks ZYNQ_CORE_gmii_to_rgmii_0_0_rgmii_tx_clk and gmii_clk_125m_out (see constraint position 28 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#3 Critical Warning
